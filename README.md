# Arithmetic-Calculator-Python
This code is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. The program prints out a message asking the user to select an operation by entering the corresponding number. After selecting an operation, the program prompts the user to input two numbers to perform the operation. If the user inputs an invalid number or character, the program displays an error message. Once the calculation is complete, the program prompts the user to perform another calculation or exit the program.

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Run the code in an appropriate environment
2. Enter the corresponding number to the operation you want to perform
3. Input the two numbers you want to perform the operation on
4. If you want to perform another calculation, enter "yes" when prompted. Otherwise, enter "no" to exit the program.
